Task 2.a 
We used the acceptance mode in Spin since this is a liveness property, to check that both Alice and Bob execute fully eventually
Task 2.b 
Weak fairness affects the answer since weak fairness ensures that they will eventually execute, even though they could be kept waiting while they are executing, or get stuck in a deadlock.
We compiled without the -f flag, so this property should hold without weak fairness.
Task 3.a 
We once again used the acceptance mode in spin since the property is a liveness property.
Task 3.b 
We did not run spin with weak fairness, so with weak fairness the property might have held.
Task 3.c 
Looking at the trail, the Introder is performing a type of replay attack 
where it forges a message msg1 and sends to Bob, and while Bob prepares a message. the Introdes does the same for Alice, 
thus interrupting the three-way handshake to start a conversation. 
Task 6.a 
Used acceptance since we are testing for liveliness. 
Task 6.b 
Weak fairness once again makes it so that the check will pass if it eventually executes, and it requires the procedure to be continuously executable. 
Task 6.c 
propAB: Since only Alice have implemented awareness for the Intruder, 
she is aware that she is talking to the Intruder; but Bob thinks she is talking to him. 
propA: Spin does not report a violation of propA in this execution because Alice did not think she was talking to Bob.
propB: Holds, since Bob thinks he talked to Alice and the intruder does not know Bobâ€™s nonce.
Task 7:
The patch works because it prevents the intruder from successfully impersonating another principal and thereby blocks replay attacks that previously caused the protocol to fai
This fixed the flaw of step 2 where there was no identification of the sender Y. 
Task 8:
While we can never be 100% sure that the protocol is safe, due to weak fairness as well as the possibility that there could be more 
potential violations not accounted for in the ltl protocols, we are still pretty confident in our solution given the circumstances and
limitations of spin, we would say we are perhaps 80-90% sure.
