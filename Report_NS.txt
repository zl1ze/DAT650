Task 2.a 
We used the acceptance mode in Spin since this is a liveness property, to check that both Alice and Bob execute fully eventually
Task 2.b 
Weak fairness affects the answer since weak fairness ensures that they will eventually execute, even though they could be kept waiting while they are executing, or get stuck in a deadlock.
We compiled without the -f flag, so this property should hold without weak fairness.
Task 3.a 
We once again used the acceptance mode in spin since the property is a liveness property.
Task 3.b 
We did not run spin with weak fairness, so with weak fairness the property might have held.
Task 3.c 
Looking at the trail, it appears to get interrupted while Bob waits for the First message from Alice, due to the message getting interrupted by the intruder.
