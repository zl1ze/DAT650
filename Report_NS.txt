Task 2.a 
We used the acceptance mode in Spin since this is a liveness property, to check that both Alice and Bob execute fully eventually
Task 2.b 
Weak fairness affects the answer since weak fairness ensures that they will eventually execute, even though they could be kept waiting while they are executing, or get stuck in a deadlock.
We compiled without the -f flag, so this property does hold without weak fairness.
