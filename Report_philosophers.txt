Task 2.1
To implement the assertions and make sure that a fork can only be used by one philosopher at a time, the array int held[N] is created globally, 
and atomically incremented and asserted every time a fork is picked up held[id]++ and (assert(held[id] == 1)), and when dropped it is decremented
and asserted that held[id]is 0.
